We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

[![GitHub pull requests](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-pr/lara123321/Port-Scanner-?color=blue&logo=github)](https://github.com/lara123321/Port-Scanner-/pulls) [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/lara123321/Port-Scanner-?logo=github)](https://github.com/lara123321/Port-Scanner-/issues) 

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Write clear meaningful git commit messages.
3. Always create PR to `develop` branch.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!
